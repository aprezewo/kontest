# kontest
A concentration-test (in german: Konzentrationstest) to sharpen ones concentration.

This project was initially commissioned to me by a dear friend, who needed to practice for the entrance exams of the police. The user will be 
presented with different symbols, to which either 1 or 0 belongs. Hitting the right button will count as a successfull hit, and the pointer
switches to the next symbol. To win, the user needs to work through a minimum amount of symbols, and have a minimum percentage of succesfull hits.

Included in the executable is a manual and a configuration menu.
