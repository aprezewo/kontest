# kontest
A concentration-test (in german: Konzentrationstest) to sharpen ones concentration.

This project was initially commissioned to me by a dear friend, who needed to practice for the entrance exams of the police. The user will be 
presented with different symbols, associated with either 1 or 0. Hitting the correct button counts as a successfull hit, and the pointer
will move to the next symbol. To win, the user has to work through a minimum amount of symbols and have a minimum percentage of succesfull hits.

Included in the executable is a manual and a configuration menu.

Executables can be found under this link, using the password below. Builds are made using jlink, targeting the following platforms:
-Windows10
-Linux
-MacOS

For Windows, the program is available via a Microsoft Installer executable (.msi).
